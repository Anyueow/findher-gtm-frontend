        <br/>
        If you’re ready to onboard your business, book a time with us

        At FindHer, we are guided by the simple belief that a job is more than its description,
        and candidates are more than resumes.
        To create the best matches, both sides need information that
        goes overlooked in traditional job platforms – <strong> things like workplace culture,
            company values, team dynamics, and so on.</strong>

        This is a problem that disproportionately impacts women.
        Why? Because women have unique workplace experiences,
        face distinct challenges, and prioritize differently
        in job searches compared to men.

        <br/>
        <br/>
        Our solution? We've created a platform that makes this essential information available -
        front and center - enabling businesses and female
        candidates to connect more effectively.
        Now, for businesses like yours, this means a
        more streamlined hiring process, better quality applicants,
        better cultural fits, and ultimately, a more diverse workforce
        (and don’t even get us started on the benefits of that).

        <br/> <br/>
        Here’s how we do this for you:
        <br/> <br/>

        <strong>1) Standout Company Profile:</strong><br/>
        We'll create a unique company profile for you on FindHer and populate it with valuable information for female applicants not available elsewhere. This will help your business attract top female talent that are aligned with you.
        <br/> <br/>

        <strong>2) Effective Job Matching:</strong><br/>
        We'll delve deep into compatibility and carefully curate a list of the best candidates for your open roles using our AI. This means you'll spend less time sifting through resumes and more time connecting with candidates who are a great fit for your organization.
        <br/> <br/>

        <strong>3) Effortless Insights:</strong> <br/>
        We'll send a survey to your female employees and provide you with confidential insights to easily enhance the female employee experience. We'll also showcase the best of this on your company profile to inspire more applicants. The result? Higher employee satisfaction, retention, and growth.
